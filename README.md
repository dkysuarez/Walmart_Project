## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict Walmart sales using data science techniques and machine learning. The project consists of two main parts: a Jupyter Notebook covering the entire data science process, from data preprocessing to model creation, and a Streamlit web application for improved result visualization.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **notebook**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the complete data science process, including data preprocessing, handling missing data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and predictive model creation.
- **web_app**: Includes the necessary files for the Streamlit web page, where project results can be visualized.

## Usage Instructions

To view the web page, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the project's root folder.
3. Execute the following command to start the web application:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to the address provided by Streamlit to view the page.
